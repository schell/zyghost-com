# ðŸš§ Projects

I have a number of ongoing projects that you can investigate or
contribute to :) These are labors of love and engineering.

## Web Applications

#### [todo-mvc-bench](http://zyghost.com/projects/todo-mvc-bench/index.html)
A suite for interactively benchmarking various todomvc implementations.

## Software Libraries

#### [mogwai](https://github.com/schell/mogwai/) ![](../img/rust.svg "for Rust")
The *M*inimal *O*bvious *G*raphical *W*eb *A*pplication *I*nterface.
It's a library for writing frontend web apps in Rust.

#### [steeloverseer](https://github.com/schell/steeloverseer) ![](../img/haskell.svg "for Haskell")
A file watcher and development tool, similar to Ruby's Guard.

The main idea is that you have steeloverseer watch your files and then execute a
series of shell commands in response. The first command to fail short circuits
the series. The watched files can be selected using regular expressions and the
commands may include capture groups.


#### [varying](https://github.com/schell/varying) ![](../img/haskell.svg "for Haskell")
Continuously varying values, made easy :)

An FRP implementation like netwire, but simpler.

### Consulting and Contracting
I have 15 years of experience building apps of all sizes, distributed services and parsers.
I enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust but I'm also proficient in C, Objective C,
Javascript and AS3.

If I must I can write C++, Java or Go.

I can read Lisp.

I'd like to learn Prolog.

I have a day job at [Software Ltd. / Narrative](https://narrative.so), so my services
are limited to after hours (in New Zealand).
