# ðŸš§ Projects

I have a number of ongoing projects that you can investigate or
contribute to :) These are labors of love and engineering.

## [renderling](https://renderling.xyz) ![](../img/rust.svg "for Rust") [<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/schell/renderling)
A GPU-driven, real-time, forward+ renderer with an ergonomic API. Runs everywhere.

I keep a [devlog at the renderling.xyz website](https://renderling.xyz/devlog/index.html).

In 2024 I was awarded a grant from the [nlnet](https://nlnet.nl) foundation to work 
on `renderling` and `wgpu`.

## [apecs](https://github.com/schell/apecs) ![](../img/rust.svg "for Rust")
An async-friendly entity component system.

## [mogwai](https://github.com/schell/mogwai/) ![](../img/rust.svg "for Rust")
The *M*inimal *O*bvious *G*raphical *W*eb *A*pplication *I*nterface.
It's a library for writing frontend web apps in Rust.

## [varying](https://github.com/schell/varying) ![](../img/haskell.svg "for Haskell")
Continuously varying values, made easy :)

An FRP implementation like netwire, but simpler.

_This was one of my first published libraries. It's no longer active, but I keep it 
listed here for sentimental reasons._

## Consulting and Contracting
Since 2004 I've been building apps of all sizes, distributed services, parsers and games.
I enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust but I'm also proficient in C, Objective C,
Javascript and AS3.

If I must I can write C++, Java or Go.

I can read Lisp.

I'd like to learn Prolog.

I have a day job at [Software Ltd. / Narrative](https://narrative.so), so my services
are limited to after hours (in New Zealand).
