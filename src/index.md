A zyghost is the essence of a thing before, during and after that thing's existence.
It is a thorough description of what a thing is - the instructions needed to create it.
A zyghost is a timeless, permanent encoding of a thing that transcends the thing itself.

My name is Schell Scivally and this is my blog.
I'm a guy in ~~Northern California~~ New Zealand who likes to bike, skate, build, and write about things I'm working
on.

I like the idea of DNA, code, blueprints and plans as the zyghost of things that can exist in the physical world.
This blog serves to explore defining a zyghost and summoning it into existence.
