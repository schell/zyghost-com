A zyghost is the essence of a thing before, during and after that thing's
existence. It is a thorough description of what a thing is: the instructions
needed to create it. In that, a zyghost is an encoding of a thing
that transcends the thing itself.

My name is Schell Scivally and this is my blog.
I'm a guy in ~~Northern California~~ New Zealand who likes to code, play,
build and write about things I'm working on.

I like the idea of DNA, code, blueprints and plans as the zyghost of things
that exist in the physical and digital planes. 

This blog serves as a very loose guide to my zyghosts. 

Follow along as I summon them into existence.
