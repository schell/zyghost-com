Around the web I'm found with the handles `schell`, `schellsan` and `efnx`.

You can find me at:
  * `schell` on GitHub
  * `efnx` at Hacker News
  * `schellsan` on reddit
  * `schellsan` on twitter (though I don't use that)
  * `efsubenovex` at the `gmail` dot `com`
  * `schell.scivally` at `narrative` dot `so`

You can also see links to the social media sites that I sometimes use in the ^header above.

## Consulting and Contracting
Since 2004 I've been building apps of all sizes, distributed services, parsers and games.
I enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust but I'm also proficient in C, Objective C,
Javascript and AS3.

If I must I can write C++, Java or Go.

I can read Lisp.

I'd like to learn Prolog.

I have a day job at [Software Ltd. / Narrative](https://narrative.so), so my services
are limited to after hours (in New Zealand).
