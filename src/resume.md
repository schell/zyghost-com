I'm passionate about functional programming, real time graphics and sound synthesis.
In my free time I like to build things and play games with my kids.
In the past I've made music with my friends and played shows, toured the US with a band, drove forklifts in a chemical plant and bailed hay in three states.

## Open Source Work

- I'm a [maintainer of Rust-GPU](https://rust-gpu.github.io/blog/2024/11/06/new-maintainers), which is a Rust compiler that generates SPIR-V shaders.
- I [added support for atomic operations to `wgpu`'s transpiler SPIR-V frontend](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/4489).
- I am an [NLNet grantee, working on a cross-platform GPU-driven renderer that runs on WebGPU](https://nlnet.nl/project/Renderling/).
- Authored [renderling](https://github.com/schell/renderling), a 3d physically-based renderer with easy resource management.
- Authored [crabslab](https://github.com/schell/crabslab), a slab allocator for working with GPUs in Rust.
- I contributed [RenderLayers to the popular Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1209).
- I authored [typograffiti](https://github.com/schell/typograffiti/), a text renderer written in Haskell. 
  * I am the initial author but have since moved on to `renderling`. 
  * I handed off maintainership of `typograffiti` to Adrian Cochrane (**alcinnz** on github) who himself is a NLNet grantee.
