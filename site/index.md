A zyghost is the essence of a thing before, during and after that thing\'s
existence. It is a thorough description of what a thing is - the
instructions needed to create it. A zyghost is a timeless, permanent
encoding of a thing that transcends the thing itself.

My name is Schell Scivally and this is my blog. I\'m a guy in Northern
California who likes to bike, skate, build, and write about things I\'m working
on.

I like the idea of DNA, code, blueprints and plans as the zyghost of things that
can exist in the physical world and this blog serves to explore the process
that brings a zyghost into existence.
