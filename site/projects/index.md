Projects
--------

I have a number of ongoing projects that you can investigate, buy, use or
contribute to :) These are labors of love and engineering - some of them are free
and some are not. Some of them serve a purpose and some do not!

Apps 
====

#### [todo-mvc-bench](todo-mvc-bench/)
A suite for interactively benchmarking various todomvc implementations.

Software
========

#### [mogwai](https://github.com/schell/mogwai/)
<date>2019/12/??</date>
`mogwai` is the *M*inimal *O*bvious *G*raphical *W*eb *A*pplication *I*nterface.
It's a library for writing frontend web apps in Rust.

#### [steeloverseer](https://github.com/schell/steeloverseer)
<date>2013/04/29</date>
A file watcher and development tool, similar to Ruby's Guard.

The main idea is that you have steeloverseer watch your files and then execute a
series of shell commands in response. The first command to fail short circuits
the series. The watched files can be selected using regular expressions and the
commands may include capture groups.


#### [varying](https://github.com/schell/varying)
<date>2015/05/05</date>
Continuously varying values, made easy :)

An FRP implementation like netwire, but simpler.


Services
========

#### [Electrunique](https://electrunique.com)
<date>2011/01/26</date>
Electrunique is a unique electronics boutique. We're building the spiritual
successor to the Datahand keyboard and other oddities.


#### [Source of Truth](http://srcoftruth.com)
<date>2017/07/24</date>
This is a github bot for tracking todos and technical debt in source code.

After installing the bot (one-click), it finds these todos in your source code on
every push, opening and maintaining a ticket for each unique todo. When that todo
is no longer found in your source code the bot closes the ticket for you.

For the time being this service is free as in beer.


#### [Contracting](#)
<date>2003/??/??</date>
I offer contracting services. I've been programming since 2003 and primarily
enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust. I'm also proficient in C, C++, Objective C,
Javascript, Java and AS3. I can read Lisp and Scala.

I have a day job at [Formation, Inc.](https://formation.ai) :), so my services
are limited to after hours.

[Contact me](/contact/)!
