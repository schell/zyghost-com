Projects
--------

I have a number of ongoing projects that you can investigate, buy, use or
contribute to :) These are labors of love and engineering - some of them are free
and some are not. Some of them serve a purpose and some do not!

Apps
====

#### [todo-mvc-bench](todo-mvc-bench/)
A suite for interactively benchmarking various todomvc implementations.

Software
========

#### [mogwai](https://github.com/schell/mogwai/) ![](/img/rust.svg)
The *M*inimal *O*bvious *G*raphical *W*eb *A*pplication *I*nterface.
It's a library for writing frontend web apps in Rust.

#### [steeloverseer](https://github.com/schell/steeloverseer) ![](/img/haskell.svg)
A file watcher and development tool, similar to Ruby's Guard.

The main idea is that you have steeloverseer watch your files and then execute a
series of shell commands in response. The first command to fail short circuits
the series. The watched files can be selected using regular expressions and the
commands may include capture groups.


#### [varying](https://github.com/schell/varying) ![](/img/haskell.svg)
Continuously varying values, made easy :)

An FRP implementation like netwire, but simpler.


Services
========

#### Contracting
I offer contracting services. I have 15 years of experience building apps of all
sizes, distributed services and parsers.
I enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust but I'm also proficient in C, Objective C,
Javascript and AS3.

If I must I can write C++, Java or Go.

I can read Lisp.

I'd like to learn Prolog.

I have a day job at [Formation, Inc.](https://formation.ai) :), so my services
are limited to after hours.

[Contact me](/contact/)!
