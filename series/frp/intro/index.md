## Discovery

[FRP has been around for a long time](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/). Originally discovered and coined by Conal Elliot
and Paul Hudak in the late 90's it represented a new approach to writing dynamic systems, wherein the programmer describes
how the system changes over time using continuous semantics. What this meant practically is that FRP code tended to look
more like interelated equations and less like a list of steps to achieve a goal.

As time went on more implementations were made and the term got thrown around freely, eventually even being applied to
other technologies like Javascript's React framework. These days when folks talk about React, bacon.js,
etc. they tend to drop the "functional" part of FRP in favor of "reactive", which suits the nature of those frameworks
better. [Check out the wikipedia article on FRP for more info on what it is, specifically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)

## Prep Work

An FRP system deals in terms of continuous values and discrete events. Continuous values are often referred to as `Behavior`s
while discrete events are simply ... you guessed it ... `Event`s! What this means is that your values always come
wrapped in these contexts. For this reason I've been known to call writing FRP code as "advanced burrito making".
The newly popular (as of the first writing of this article) [reflex](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex) package adds another context - one that
combines `Behavior`s and `Event`s, called `Dynamic`s. Reflex's brand of FRP is "very advanced burrito making" ;)

In any implementation there are lots of functions for turning a value in one context into a value in
another context ... so if you are going to write in FRP I would recommend being really, really familiar with the basic
typeclasses:

* [Functor](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Functor)
* [Applicative](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Applicative)
* [Monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Monad)
* [Monad transformers](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Monad_transformers)

and if you've got the time it would really help to get these bad boys in as well -

* [MonadFix](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#MonadFix)
  - More on that here: [MonadFix is Time Travel](http://elvishjerricco.github.io/2017/08/22/monadfix-is-time-travel.html)
* [Arrow](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Arrow) (but don't get too carried away with Arrows, they're deep and wide)

[The haskell wiki has more info on how FRP libs use these typeclasses.](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_Reactive_Programming)

Then once you have a grasp on the supporting machinery we can talk a bit about `Behavior`s and `Event`s.

## Behaviors

I find it beneficial to think of a `Behavior` as a function - like a mathematical function from your last
physics class. Have you taken a physics class? No worries! This is just algebra!

Let's use Newton's law of gravitation, `f = g * (m1 * m2) / r ** 2`, where `f` is the force
between two bodies of mass `m1` and `m2` respectively, `g` is a gravitational constant, which is just a number, and
`r` is the distance between the centers of the two bodies. In a `Behavior`al context we can express this equation
quite simply and quite literally by saying that if each term (`g`, `m1`, `m2` and `r`) are `Behavior`s themselves,
then `f` is also a `Behavior`. Even better, if the FRP lib you choose defines [Num](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Num) and [Fractional](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Fractional)
instances for its `Behavior` type then we can define `f` as the equation itself:

```haskell
f g m1 m2 r = g * (m1 * m2) / r ** 2
```
In this case `g` is a constant, and due to `Fractional`'s [fromRational](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:fromRational)
we should be able to construct a `Behavior` for `g` simply using a float literal:

```haskell
f m1 m2 r = 6.674eâˆ’11 * (m1 * m2) / r ** 2
```

So let's say the bodies we're finding the force between are planets. Then let's exclaim "we have a type for that!":
```haskell
data Planet = Planet { planetMass     :: Float
                     , planetPosition :: V2 Float -- this is just a vector like (Float, Float), see the linear package
                     }

planetA = Planet 10 $ V2 0 0
planetB = Planet 100 $ V2 250 250
```

POOF! Planetary formation. Now we need to know how these planets change over time. Oooor we can assume they don't.
Either way we need a planet in a `Behavior`al context. `Behavior`s are often (always?) `Applicative`s. They have
a first order kind (or more) like `* -> *`. In plain terms the `Behavior` type takes another type and wraps it in
its context. This is `Functor` and `Applicative` stuff. So a planet in a `Behavior`al context would be something
like `Behavior Planet`. Up until now I've left off the type variable in `Behavior`, but it should really be
`Behavior a`, where `a` is any type.

Now, since many (all?) FRP implementations provide an `Applicative` instance for their `Behavior a` type, we can construct
some `Behavior Planet`s:

```haskell
planetBehaviorA = pure planetA
planetBehaviorB = pure planetB
```

These planet's don't change over time. These rocks just sit. Which reminds me of a poem:

> Nobody sits like this rock sits.
> You rock, rock.
> The rock just sits - and is.
> You show us how to just sit here
> And that's what we need.
> -- [Albert Markovski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i8-t5biK10)

Now that we have what we need (a couple of sitty rocks) we can write the other `Behavior`s we need, using
`Functor` to great lengths ... and masses.

```haskell
posBehaviorA  = fmap planetPos planetBehaviorA
posBehaviorB  = fmap planetPos planetBehaviorB
massBehaviorA = fmap planetMass planetBehaviorA
massBehaviorB = fmap planetMass planetBehaviorB
```

Great! Now, we have `Behavior (V2 Float)`s for the planet's positions over time, but what we need is the
vector between them. We're going to assume that `V2` has a `Num` instance (and it does, if we're talking
about [this](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-1.20.7/docs/Linear-V2.html) `V2`). Assuming this
means we can treat it just like any other number because remember `Behavior a` also has a `Num` instance,
at least for `a`s that have a `Num` instance (in this case `V2`) ... so:

```haskell
vectorAB = posBehaviorA - posBehaviorB
```

And that's enough to get us the rest of the way:

```haskell
gForceAB = f massBehaviorA massBehaviorB vectorAB
```

## Events

## A tour of FRP flavors
Evan Czaplicki of Elm fame did a great talk on the different flavors of FRP, and he does a better job describing them
than I could:

## Wrap up that FRP-rrito
Hopefully that gives a little background to the situation. FRP has come a long way since 1997 but it's really still
an area of active research.
Stay tuned for the next installment where we'll look at some more Haskell code.
