This is a sporadic series on building a roguelike using some of my own libraries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [Part 1 - Infrastructure with GLFW](/series/odin/part-one)
<date>2016/02/12</date>
Creating the infrastructure using GLFW-b. This is a rough first setup.

#### [Part 1.5 - Infrastructure with SDL2](/series/odin/part-one-sdl2)
<date>2016/02/16</date>
Porting the infrastructure to SDL2. This is also a rough first setup, and simply
swaps `GLFW-b` for `sdl2`.

#### [Part 2 - Joystick Control](/series/odin/part-two)
<date>2016/04/07</date>
Adding some simple character control mechanism.
